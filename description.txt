This project is a clone of Instagram designed to be used on mobile browsers only. It has a fully-functional user interface with abilities to upload posts, comment on posts, like/dislike posts and chat one-on-one with other users. It uses Next.js for routing and server-side data-fetching from a Firebase Cloud Store and Cloud Storage, and uses MaterialUI for the front-end with Recoil for global state management.
